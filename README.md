ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in transitioning from civil engineering to tech, focusing on machine learning, data engineering, and cybersecurity. I enjoy working with data (tabular, images, etc.) and Iâ€™m also curious about cloud technologies and cybersecurity's growth potential.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AWS Cloud (working towards the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner) and deploying machine learning models using AWS SageMaker. Iâ€™ve also completed the Google Cloud course, Kaggle Titanic project, and Courseraâ€™s Machine Learning and Deep Learning Specializations.

 I use [Pomodoro Tracker](https://pomodoro-tracker.com/user/227191]) to structure my deep work sessions  

ðŸ’– Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on machine learning projects, sentiment analysis, and projects involving data engineering or cybersecurity. Iâ€™d also love to connect with others transitioning from engineering to tech.
 
ðŸ’Œ How to reach me: Feel free to message me on GitHub or connect on LinkedIn.

ðŸŽ‰ Fun fact: Iâ€™m also planning my first marathon in Europe, aiming for a scenic, memorable experience!

ðŸ¤— Bonus fun facts: I love cooking and experimenting with new recipesâ€”especially when I get to share them with friends. Iâ€™m also a big cat person, and I believe every good coding session is better with a cat nearby!
